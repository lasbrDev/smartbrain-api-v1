# Smart Brain - Face Recognition


This is an amazing Backend API, developed with NodeJS and ExpressJS. Basically this API, detect the face area of ​​any jpg image captured from any web page, how cool is that?

Frontend is located in another repository, which you can check out [here](https://github.com/lasbrDev/smartbrainapi).





## Reference

 - [Node.org](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides)
 - [Clarifai API](https://clarifai.com/clarifai/main/models/face-detection)
 - [NPMJS](https://www.npmjs.com/)
 - [Postman](https://quickstarts.postman.com/)
 - [ExpressJS *](https://expressjs.com/pt-br/guide/routing.html)
 - [NestJS *](https://docs.nestjs.com/)

## Appendix

This API was developed with the ExpressJS framework, but is being migrated to NestJS. The motivation for the change is API scalability, unit testing, and improving application functionality regarding decoupling.



## Demonstration

- Access the application address  [here](https://facedetect-smartbrain.netlify.app/);
- Make a small registration (name and email);
- Capture a jpg face image from the web and paste it inside the indicated field;
- See app detecting face.

## Deploy

I used 3 platforms to deploy. One for the Frontend, one for the Backend and one for the PostgreSQL Database.


- [Netlifly](https://www.netlify.com/) for Frontend;
- [Cyclic](https://www.cyclic.sh/) for Backend (server);
- [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/) for database which is a PostgreSQL as a service.


## Learnings

This project was very challenging, I managed to fully understand how a real API works, through validations, tests and deploy, which was a step that required a lot of attention and a lot of reading. Because I was using a free service, I had to perform this deploy operation on 3 different platforms, which certainly made me reach another level in my career as a developer. Many things still need to be updated and improved, it's just the beginning. Let's go ahead.



## Stack 

**Frontend:** React

**Backend:** Node, Express -> Nest
